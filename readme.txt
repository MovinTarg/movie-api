Using The Movie DB create a responsive one-page app that allows the user to search for movies by title. Save the result to the database and then all results should be shown to the user. If a query returns more than one result only the first should be saved. Both the form submission and updating the display should be handled with AJAX.

Unlike the PokeApi, The Movie DB requires an API key to be accessed. Visit the TMDB website for instructions on how to obtain a key and guides on how to query their API.
